Life is a real time sandbox role game where you play as yourself surviving in today's
world. You start with a predefined character sharing space with other
players in a gigantic map, a limit number of resources, and the
clock ticking. As time flies by, you take decisions against the
events you find yourself involved in, shaping your path towards the unavoidable
end. The outcome of those choices is not guaranteed, a powerful system will
decide the result evaluating your stats against other players involved and the
environment state.

As you play Life, your character stats will be affected by the liven events, and
you'll earn money and experience points.  Money can be used to purchase supplies
to survive or objects to improve your gear or boost your player stats.
Experience points are won by achieving challenges and completing important story
lines, and can be used to unlock new skills that will help you overcome new and
harder challenges.  Unlike other games, leveling up has nothing to do with
experience points. Every player levels up only once each 365 days on a ceremony
called *birthday*.
